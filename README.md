# Ember-cli-famous

The goal of this project is to make developing ember apps using famous easier.
Currently we provide famous to be imported and used. We are working on creating
a collection of components similar to [famous-angular](https://github.com/Famous/famous-angular)
to make it even easier to use.

## Installation

* `npm install --save-dev ember-cli-famous`
* `ember generate ember-cli-famous`

## Usage

In your app you can import the famous library wherever you want to use it:

```js
import Surface from 'famous/core/Surface';
// Then use famous directly. Likely this will be in your components.
```
